### Acknowledgements

Gratefully thanks [Jichang Zhao](http://www.zhaojichang.cn/), the lecturer of this course, who fascinated and enlightened me to tackle complex problems and push our personal laptop to the performance limit etc by using python. This is an absolute useful and practical course both for both our professional study and future career. If you have read here patiently , I shall give you my suggestion, which is simply listening carefully during class and trying your best to complete every single assignment. After a semester of hardworking, I guarantee that your coding ability shall be improved to another level. 祝好.
